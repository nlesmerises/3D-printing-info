Drying and keeping your filament dry.

3D printer filament drying reference kit (UK but I'm sure you can find US 
variations of identical or similar brands; possibly cheaper too).

The beads; silica dessicant - chuck in tonnes of this in each box.  This stuff is 
rechargeable in a microwave.

IMHO a very good filament dryer on the market right now; iteration 2, based on feedback from 3d 
printerers like you and me.

A cheap but effective hygrometer for measuring humidity (and temp as it happens); I have one in 
each box and also one reference one, in the same room, to see how effective my drying is.
