# Slicers

Cura UI and Prusa Slicer UI are a matter of taste.
I have since migrated to Super Slicer which has way more options than Prusa Slicer.
To migrate from Prusa Slicer to Super Slicer simply export a Config Bundle and import it into Super Slicer.

Cura (at least v5 and earlier, though it's got faster in v5) is much slower when compared with Prusa slicer or Super slicer for 

a) loading obj and STL large files

and 

b) slicing.

For reference all slicing was performed on a Macbook air M1 chip 2020 model with 16GB memory and a 256GB SSD.
