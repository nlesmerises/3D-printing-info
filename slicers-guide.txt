Slicers
These are my opinions:
Cura has a nicer UI, though I rather like the prusa slicer UI also. 

These are the facts: Cura is way slower compared to Prusa slicer for 
a) loading obj and STL large files
and 
b) slicing.
Note: Superslicer has more options for fine tuning your slicing than prusa 
slicer or cura.

For reference this is performed on a Macbook air M1 chip 2021 model with 
16GB memory and a 256GB SSD.
