Slicers
These are my opinions:
Cura UI and Prusa Slicer UI are a matter of taste.
I have since migrated to Super Slicer which has way more options than Prusa Slicer.
To migrate from Prusa Slicer to Super Slicer simply export a Config Bundle and import it into Super Slicer.

These are the facts: Cura is way slower compared to Prusa slicer for 
a) loading obj and STL large files
and 
b) slicing.

For reference this is performed on a Macbook air M1 chip 2021 model with 
16GB memory and a 256GB SSD.
