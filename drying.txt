Drying; updated

3D printer filament drying reference kit (UK but I'm sure you can find US 
variations of identical or similar brands; possibly cheaper too).
https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B01H2SZRS2/ the box(es) - 80L
https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B087T2GBPX/ the beads; silica 
dessicant - chuck in tonnes of this in each box.  This stuff is 
rechargeable.
https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B09WYBY8X8/ IMHO a very good filament 
dryer on the market right now; iteration 2, based on feedback from 3d 
printerers like you and me.
https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B01H1R0K68/ a cheap but effective 
hygrometer for measuring humidity (and temp as it happens); I have one in 
each box and also one reference one, in the same room, to see how 
effective my drying is.
